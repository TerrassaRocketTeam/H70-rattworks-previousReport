\section*{Gas pressure and state}

A basic study of the gas state and pressure inside the tanks has been conducted. To do so, the properties of the $N_2O$ have been extracted from \cite{n2oReference}. With the equations presented on the former source, a simple Matlab code has been built that generate the chart in \ref{fig:N2O_P_V_graph}, said code can be found in \cite{MatlabPVchart}.
