\section*{Objectives}

The main objectives that need to be accomplished with the static fire are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Perfect the launch and ignition sequence and assesses its correct operation. The work on this sequence is not done from scratch since several years ago former and current students of the TRT already ignited the hybrid motor. All the same they never managed to fly a rocket with the motor.
  \item Familiarize the part of the team that has never worked with this engine with the sequences, peculiarities and behavior of this type of rocket engines.
  \item Improve the security measures. Since the operation of this rocket engine requires high pressure oxidant gas security measures are more important than ever.
  \item Improve the thrust curve quality. The completely new test bench and electronics will ensure more reliable and constant data. 
\end{itemize}
