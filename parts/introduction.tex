\section*{Introduction}

On the aeronautical engineering degree students improve their theoretical knowledge about this discipline. But the feeling among the students is that we canâ€™t apply this knowledge until we finish studying and start working. This is the reason why some of us join a students team such as Terrassa Rocket Team (TRT) where we can join other students interested in rocket modeling. Together we improve our skills in making different types of rockets like a two-stage rocket, a supersonic one, rockets with deployable wings, etc. Some of us inside TRT are focusing on a new challenge: a hybrid rocket.
All the same, before launching a rocket with a hybrid motor, we've organized a static fire to assess the thrust curve and test the launching process.
