\section*{Introduction}

During the degree of aeronautical engineering the students improve their theoretical knowledge about this discipline. But the feeling among the students is that we canâ€™t apply this knowledge until we finish studding and start working. This is the reason why some of us join an students team such as Terrassa Rocket Team (TRT) where we can join other students interested in rocket modeling. Together we improve our skills in making different types of rockets like a two-stage rocket, a supersonic one, rockets with deployable wings, etc. Some of us inside TRT are focusing in a new challenge: an hybrid rocket.
All the same, before launching a rocket with an hybrid motor, we've organized an static fire to asses the thrust curve and test the launching process.
